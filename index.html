As well as our breakfast and lunch menu, we have a carefully selected wine list and extensive range of freshly baked cakes.
We are also pleased to offer an outside catering service, anything from bespoke picnics in the park to office lunches. Come and talk to us and we can help put together a bespoke package that fits your needs.
Our centrally located cafe is available to hire in the evenings for private parties, exhibitions and pop up projects.">

                    carefully selected a single-estate Nicaraguan bean which forms the foundation of all our delicious coffees. Not only are the beans directly traded, which means more money for the growers, Brian

                    Wogan also sponsors students on the Teach a Man To Fish education charity.

                    Henny & Joe’s Chai has become a firm favourite on the hot drinks menu & we are lucky to have

                    known its creators for many years. This too, is made in Bath.

                    On the chilled drinks front, we freshly squeeze our orange juice & make our own zingy lemonade

                    to order. <br/><br/>We source the remainder of our soft drinks directly from Ashridge drinks company, wholly

                    Organic & based in Devon.<br/><br/><img src="images/drink_3.jpg" width="200px" height="134px" align="left" class="inlineimg_left">

                    We are fully licensed which has allowed us to hand pick a fantastic selection of alcoholic drinks.

                    Our wine list is small but carefully chosen to offer exceptional quality at an affordable price.

                    Whites, Reds, Rose & Sparkling are all available by the glass or bottle.<br/><br/>

                    We also stock bottled ales from both Bath Ales & Wiper & True in Bristol. The cider we have

                    selected to sell is Honey’s Midford Cider which is made just twelve miles out of Bath.<br/><br/>
